# CCSwitcher

CCSwitcher is a lightweight, pure menu bar macOS application designed to help developers manage and switch between multiple Claude Code accounts **without interrupting your multi-account workflow**. The native `claude auth login` flow is destructive — every switch wipes the previous account's credentials and forces another full browser OAuth. CCSwitcher keeps a per-account backup of every credential, atomically swaps the keychain entry and `~/.claude.json` on switch, and all accounts stay available for one-click swap-back. CCSwitcher also monitors API usage, gracefully handles background token refreshes, and circumvents common macOS menu bar app limitations.


> **About this fork**
>
> This is a fork of [XueshiQiao/CCSwitcher](https://github.com/XueshiQiao/CCSwitcher) that adds
> **dev box support** and **model-scoped quota windows**: the upstream app reads the Mac it runs
> on and its 5-hour and weekly limits, while this one also watches and controls Claude Code
> accounts on remote machines, and surfaces per-model windows such as Fable.
>
> **Model-scoped quota (Fable, Opus)**
>
> - **In the usage dashboard.** The usage API's `limits[]` array is decoded, so model-scoped
>   windows appear as their own bars next to the 5-hour and weekly ones. The older fixed keys are
>   kept as a fallback, but the API no longer populates them.
> - **In the menu bar.** Two new modules (`7d scoped`, with and without the elapsed-time marker)
>   put that window in the menu bar strip alongside the existing ones. Their label is taken from
>   the API rather than hardcoded, so the readout says `FABLE` — or whatever window the account
>   actually has — and falls back gracefully on a plan that has none.
>
> **Dev boxes**
>
> - **Remote clauth daemons.** Each dev box runs [clauth](https://github.com/uwuclxdy/clauth)'s
>   `daemon --listen`; CCSwitcher polls its REST API with ETag long-polling, so a switch made on
>   any machine reaches the menu bar as fast as the network allows instead of on a fixed interval.
>   Their windows are merged into one reading, with a warning when the boxes disagree about which
>   account they are on.
> - **Switching accounts remotely.** Every box's current account is shown in the menu and can be
>   changed from there, without opening a shell on it. A switch waits on a cross-process lock on
>   the box, so it is allowed tens of seconds and reports progress rather than appearing stuck.
> - **Certificate pinning.** The daemons' certificates are self-signed and per-host, so each one is
>   pinned by SHA-256 fingerprint (trust-on-first-use, with an explicit confirmation step after a
>   container rebuild). Bearer tokens live in the keychain, never in `UserDefaults`.
> - **Supervised SSH tunnels.** Some boxes answer ICMP but have every TCP port blocked from
>   outside their cluster, leaving the daemon unreachable at its own address even though it listens
>   on `0.0.0.0`. Such a host can be reached through an `ssh -L` forward that the app keeps alive
>   and rebuilds on its own. Local ports are probed before use — `ExitOnForwardFailure` only fires
>   when *every* bind fails, so a port already taken on `127.0.0.1` otherwise leaves `ssh`
>   listening on `::1` alone while the other process silently answers.
> - **Add a box from its SSH alias.** One alias is enough: the address, bearer token and
>   certificate are all read off the machine, and whether a tunnel is needed is settled by probing.
>   The fingerprint arrives over the authenticated SSH channel, which is a stronger pin than
>   trusting whatever answers the port first.
> - **Merged usage and cost.** Dev-box spend and message counts are aggregated on the box and
>   shipped as a small JSON, then added to the cost and activity panels — the transcript store
>   itself is never synced. Boxes that share one sessions directory are read once rather than
>   summed, so their usage is not counted three times.
> - **Activity heatmap.** A GitHub-style contribution grid over the merged history, with per-day
>   detail on hover. Intensity is rank-based; linear bucketing put nearly every day in the
>   lightest shade.
> - **A Dev Boxes settings tab.** Per-host status dot, a meter for every quota window, and — when
>   a box is unreachable — the reason plus a countdown to the next retry, so a machine that is
>   backing off reads as "retrying" rather than wedged. A changed certificate never retries on its
>   own; it waits for you to confirm the new fingerprint.
>
> **Accuracy and upkeep**
>
> - **Version-free model labels.** The model breakdown used to name specific versions
>   ("Claude Fable 5", "Opus 4"), which go stale with every release. It now names the family and
>   takes the rest from the API.
> - **Remote costs priced from the live table.** Dev-box spend is priced through the app's
>   litellm-backed pricing service. The static fallback table has no entry for current ids such as
>   `claude-opus-5`, which silently priced them at zero.
> - **Deduplicated token counts.** The remote aggregator keys on `messageId:requestId` and keeps
>   the largest output per key, matching what `ccusage` reports; without it, retried requests
>   inflated the totals several-hundred-fold. Days are bucketed in local time, not UTC, so today's
>   activity does not land on yesterday.
> - **Localized throughout.** Every string added here is in the app's five bundled languages, with
>   Simplified Chinese fully translated.
>
> Placeholder values in the dev box editor are generic in source and overridable per machine, so
> nobody's real host names end up committed:
>
> ```sh
> defaults write me.xueshi.ccswitcher devBoxExampleAlias my-box
> defaults write me.xueshi.ccswitcher devBoxExampleHost  10.1.2.3
> ```
>
> Upstream has no license file, so neither does this fork.

## Features

- **Non-Interruptive Account Switching**: The native `claude auth logout` clears the current account's credentials, and switching back requires another full OAuth. CCSwitcher keeps a separate backup of each account (keychain token + `~/.claude.json` `oauthAccount` block), atomically swaps both on switch — every added account's credentials stay intact, one-click swap-back, no workflow interruption. (Note: an in-flight `claude` session will pick up the newly-switched credentials on its next API call — this is Claude CLI behavior, not something CCSwitcher controls.)
- **Multi-Account Management**: Add and switch between different Claude Code accounts with a single click from the macOS menu bar.
- **Usage Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of your Claude API usage limits (5-hour session and weekly) directly in the menu bar dropdown, plus today's API-equivalent cost and activity stats (turns, active minutes, lines written, model breakdown).
- **Configurable Menu Bar Modules**: Build your own iStats-style menu bar readout. Choose any combination of account name, 5-hour session usage, weekly usage, today's cost, and session/weekly reset countdowns — each rendered as a compact two-line module (label over value, with monochrome progress bars for utilization). Drag to reorder and toggle modules in Settings, with a live preview.
- **Desktop Widgets**: Native macOS desktop widgets in small, medium, and large sizes showing account usage, costs, and activity stats. Includes a circular ring variant for at-a-glance usage monitoring.
- **In-App Auto-Update**: Powered by [Sparkle 2.x](https://sparkle-project.org/). New versions install silently and atomically — no DMG dragging, no Finder dialogs.
- **Dark Mode**: Full light and dark mode support with adaptive colors that follow your system appearance.
- **Internationalization**: Available in English, 简体中文 (Chinese), 日本語 (Japanese), Deutsch (German), and Français (French).
- **Privacy-Focused UI**: Automatically obfuscates email addresses and account names in screenshots or screen recordings to protect your identity.
- **Zero-Interaction Token Refresh**: Intelligently handles Claude's OAuth token expiration by delegating the refresh process to the official CLI in the background.
- **Seamless Login Flow**: Add new accounts without ever opening a terminal. The app silently invokes the CLI and handles the browser OAuth loop for you.
- **System-Native UX**: A clean, native SwiftUI interface that behaves exactly like a first-class macOS menu bar utility, complete with a fully functional settings window.

## Key Features & Architecture

CCSwitcher employs several specific architectural strategies, some uniquely tailored to its operation and others drawing inspiration from the open-source community (notably [CodexBar](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar)).

### 1. Non-Interruptive Account Switching

The headline feature: **CCSwitcher preserves every added account's credentials, so switching never interrupts your multi-account workflow.**

The native CLI has no clean "switch account" command — `claude auth logout && claude auth login` clears the current account's keychain entry and triggers a full browser OAuth round-trip; switching back to the previous account means another full OAuth. CCSwitcher takes a different path:

- Each previously-added account is stored in CCSwitcher's own per-account backup (`~/.ccswitcher/backups.json`), containing the OAuth token JSON and the matching `oauthAccount` block from `~/.claude.json`.
- When the user picks a different account, CCSwitcher atomically (a) writes the target account's token to the macOS Keychain entry `Claude Code-credentials`, and (b) overwrites the `oauthAccount` block in `~/.claude.json`. Both writes happen via Foundation file APIs — no destructive logout/login side effects.
- Result: every added account's credentials stay intact in the backup, available for one-click swap-back without re-OAuth. New `claude` invocations immediately use the newly-selected account.

**About in-flight sessions**: CCSwitcher only swaps credentials on disk; it doesn't communicate with any running `claude` process. If you switch accounts mid-session, that session's next API call will use the freshly-swapped credentials — this is the Claude CLI's behavior (it re-reads the keychain on every call), not something CCSwitcher controls. If you need an in-flight session to finish on its original account, end it before switching.

### 2. Terminal-Free Login Flow (Native `Process` + `Pipe`)

Unlike tools that build complex pseudoterminals (PTYs) to handle CLI login states, CCSwitcher uses a minimalist approach to add new accounts:

- We rely on native `Process` and standard `Pipe()` redirection.
- When `claude auth login` is executed silently in the background, the Claude CLI detects the non-interactive environment and automatically launches the system's default browser to handle the OAuth loop.
- Once the user authorizes in the browser, the background CLI process terminates with exit code 0. CCSwitcher then captures the newly-generated keychain credentials and `oauthAccount` block — the user never opens a terminal.

### 3. Delegated Token Refresh (A Different Path Than CodexBar)

Claude's OAuth access tokens have a short lifespan (~8 hours) and the refresh endpoint is protected by the Claude CLI's internal client signatures and Cloudflare. Third-party apps that want silent auto-refresh have two paths, and CCSwitcher and [CodexBar](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar) take **fundamentally different** approaches here:

- **CodexBar's approach**: directly POST to Anthropic's non-public OAuth refresh endpoint (`https://platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token`) with a hardcoded `client_id` (`9d1c250a-…`, extracted from the Claude CLI binary) plus the `refresh_token` from the keychain, then parse the response and write the new tokens back themselves. Pros: no subprocess, fast. Cons: this endpoint and client_id are **not** officially documented by Anthropic — if they rotate the client_id, change the endpoint, or add client attestation, refresh silently breaks until the next app update ships.
- **CCSwitcher's approach**: listen for `HTTP 401: token_expired` from the Anthropic Usage API; when caught, launch a silent background `claude auth status` — a read-only command — which lets the official Claude CLI use **its own, Anthropic-maintained** refresh logic to fetch a new token and write it back to the keychain. CCSwitcher re-reads the keychain and retries the usage fetch.

We deliberately chose the latter, trading a tiny per-refresh subprocess overhead for two real wins:

1. **Safer**: refresh goes through Anthropic's own CLI auth mechanism. CCSwitcher never holds or replays their internal `client_id`. If Anthropic adds stricter client-side checks (e.g. binary attestation), we automatically inherit them with no app update needed.
2. **Future-proof**: endpoint, client_id, token format — none of it is ours to maintain. CLI upgrades automatically deliver new refresh logic.

The user-visible result is the same as CodexBar's: seamless, zero-interaction. The difference is **who's on the hook for keeping up with Anthropic's private OAuth surface** — CodexBar takes that on themselves (faster, riskier); CCSwitcher delegates to the official CLI (small subprocess cost, safer).

### 4. Local JSONL Parse Cache (Performance)

Cost summaries and today's-activity stats are computed from Claude Code's per-session JSONL files under `~/.claude/projects/`. A heavy user's directory can be hundreds of megabytes across thousands of files. Re-parsing the whole tree every 5 minutes was originally CPU-pegging on idle ([#13](https://github.com/XueshiQiao/CCSwitcher/issues/13)).

- CCSwitcher maintains a persistent per-file parse cache at `~/Library/Application Support/CCSwitcher/session-parse-cache.json`, keyed by file mtime.
- On each refresh, files with unchanged mtime are skipped entirely — the cache holds their previously-parsed aggregates and the result is summed in memory.
- Only the actively-modified files (typically just your current Claude Code session) get re-parsed. Steady-state refreshes drop from ~5 seconds of saturated CPU to under 100ms.

### 5. Security-CLI Keychain Reader

Reading from the macOS Keychain via native `Security.framework` (`SecItemCopyMatching`) from a background menu bar app sometimes surfaces a blocking system UI prompt — "CCSwitcher wants to access your keychain". To bypass this, CCSwitcher adopts CodexBar's strategy:

- We execute the system-bundled tool `/usr/bin/security find-generic-password -s "Claude Code-credentials" -w`.
- When macOS prompts the user *the first time*, the user clicks **"Always Allow"**. Because the request comes from a system binary rather than our signed app, the grant persists permanently.
- Subsequent background polling is completely silent.

**About CCSwitcher's own backup keychain entries**: the per-account backup store (`me.xueshi.ccswitcher.backups`) is a keychain entry CCSwitcher creates and owns, so there's no cross-vendor prompt to dodge. We read/write it via the native `Security.framework` (`SecItemCopyMatching` / `SecItemAdd`) — no subprocess, no prompt. In short: **the `/usr/bin/security` subprocess approach is reserved specifically for the cross-vendor read of Claude Code's keychain entry; everything else uses the most direct native API.**

### 6. Team-ID-Prefixed App Group (No "Access Data From Other Apps" Prompt)

macOS 15 Sequoia silently changed the rules for App Group containers: any non-Mac-App-Store, non-TestFlight app whose App Group ID does NOT begin with the developer Team ID triggers a TCC "App Management" prompt on every launch (and again after every auto-update that changes the binary's cdhash). To avoid this, CCSwitcher's App Group is identified as `584KQTRF3B.me.xueshi.ccswitcher` — the Team-ID-prefixed form, which macOS auto-authorizes for Developer-ID-signed apps without a provisioning profile. See [#14](https://github.com/XueshiQiao/CCSwitcher/issues/14) for the full investigation.

### 7. SwiftUI `Settings` Window Lifecycle Keepalive for `LSUIElement`

Because CCSwitcher is a pure menu bar app (`LSUIElement = true`), SwiftUI refuses to present the native `Settings { … }` window — a known macOS quirk where SwiftUI assumes the app has no active scene to attach Settings to. CCSwitcher implements CodexBar's **lifecycle keepalive** workaround:

- On launch, the app creates a `WindowGroup("CCSwitcherKeepalive") { HiddenWindowView() }`.
- `HiddenWindowView` intercepts its underlying `NSWindow` and makes it a 1×1 pixel, completely transparent, click-through window positioned off-screen at `(-5000, -5000)`.
- Because this "ghost window" exists, SwiftUI is convinced the app has an active scene. When the user clicks the gear icon, we post a `Notification` that the ghost window catches to trigger `@Environment(\.openSettings)`, producing a perfectly functioning native Settings window.
